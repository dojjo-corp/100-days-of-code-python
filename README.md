# 100-days-of-code-python
I decided to do this coding challenge with python. This is meant to get my feet wet with the basics of python. Cheers to a successful journey! 
If there are any better ways of solving any of the challenges, please do not hesitate to put in your pence!

The challenges have been categorized based on difficulty levels: Beginners, Intermediate, Advanced and Professional.
Currently just finished all Beginner's levels!

_Currently facing issues merging the IntermediateChallenges branch with the master (base) branch. 
I'm working on solving it so kindly switch to the IntermediateChallenges branch to get the updated progress. 
Any help in resolving the issue will be appreciated. Thanks!_
